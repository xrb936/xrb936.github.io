summary: This study presents a QN-ACTR-based cognitive model that simulates pilot taxiing and takeoff behavior, aiming to generate human-like performance data for validating model assumptions and supporting interface design and competency-based training in aviation.
abstract: Cognitive architecture models can support the simulation and prediction of human performance in complex human-machine systems. In the current work, we demonstrate a pilot model that can perform and simulate taxiing and takeoff tasks. The model was built in Queueing Network-Adaptive Control of Thought Rational (QN-ACTR) cognitive architecture and can be connected to flight simulators such as X-Plane to generate various data, including performance, mental workload, and situation awareness. The model results are determined in combination by the declarative knowledge chunks, production rules, and a set of parameters. Currently, the model can generate flight operation behavior similar to human pilots. We will collect human pilot data to examine further and validate model assumptions and parameter values. Once validated, such models can support interface evaluation and competency-based pilot training, providing a theory-based predictive approach complementary to human-in-the-loop experiments for aviation research and development.
