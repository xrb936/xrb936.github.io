abstract: This paper reports the latest development of QN-ACTR, which integrates two
  complementary cognitive architectures, Queueing Network and Adaptive Control of
  Thought-Rational. The integrated architecture can model multitask performance in
  dynamic and complex cognitive task situations that each architecture alone has difficulties
  to model. It also allows the examination of several important modeling issues in
  ACTR from the QN perspective. Benefits from the integration are illustrated in model
  simulation of a transcription typing and reading comprehension dual-task. Future
  steps of the integration are discussed.
