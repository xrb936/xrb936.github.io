abstract: The report is based on the results of a survey developed for members of
  the Canadian Space Operations Centre (CANSpOC) to reveal and understand the Human
  Factors (HF) issues relevant to operations at the CANSpOC. The results of this survey
  were first presented to the members of CANSpOC as a Scientific Letter (DRDC-RDDC-2017-L119).
  The current report provides an expanded version of the original Scientific Letter
  in terms of the detail of the findings and the inclusion of the raw data obtained
  in the survey. The findings revealed that there are significant HF issues that impact
  the effectiveness and efficiency with which members of the CANSpOC operate. These
  findings will contribute to the development of HF evaluation methodology to augment
  the current space common operating picture concept development and evaluation process.
