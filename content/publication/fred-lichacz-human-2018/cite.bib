 abstract = {The report is based on the results of a survey developed for members of the Canadian Space Operations Centre (CANSpOC) to reveal and understand the Human Factors (HF) issues relevant to operations at the CANSpOC. The results of this survey were first presented to the members of CANSpOC as a Scientific Letter (DRDC-RDDC-2017-L119). The current report provides an expanded version of the original Scientific Letter in terms of the detail of the findings and the inclusion of the raw data obtained in the survey. The findings revealed that there are significant HF issues that impact the effectiveness and efficiency with which members of the CANSpOC operate. These findings will contribute to the development of HF evaluation methodology to augment the current space common operating picture concept development and evaluation process.},
