abstract: Drivers' take-over reaction time in partially automated vehicles is a fundamental
  component of automated vehicle design requirements, and take-over reaction time
  is affected by many factors such as distraction and drivers' secondary tasks. This
  study built cognitive architecture models to simulate drivers' take-over reaction
  time in different secondary task conditions. Models were built using the queueing
  network-adaptive control of thought rational (QN-ACTR) cognitive architecture. Drivers'
  task-specific skills and knowledge were programmed as production rules. A driving
  simulator program was connected to the models to produce prediction of reaction
  time. Model results were compared with human results in both single-task and multi-task
  conditions. The models were built without adjusting any parameter to fit the human
  data. The models could produce simulation results of take-over reaction time similar
  to the human results in take-over conditions with visual or auditory concurrent
  tasks, as well as emergency response time in a manual driving condition. Overall,
  R square was 0.96, root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.5 s, and mean absolute percentage
  error (MAPE) was 9%. The models could produce simulation results of reaction time
  similar to the human results from different task conditions. The production rules
  are plausible representations of drivers' strategies and skills. The models provide
  a useful tool for the evaluation of take-over alert design and the prediction of
  driver performance.
