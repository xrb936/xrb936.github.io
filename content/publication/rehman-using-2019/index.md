abstract: The goal of this research is to computationally model and simulate drivers'
  situation awareness (SA). In order to achieve this, we have developed a computational
  cognitive model in a cognitive architecture that can be connected to interact with
  a driving simulator, as means to infer quantitative predictions of drivers' SA.
  We demonstrate the theory of modelling and predicting SA through the lens of human
  cognition utilizing the QN-ACTR (Queueing Network-Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational)
  framework as a foundation. We integrate a dynamic visual sampling model (SEEV) to
  create QN-ACTR-SA in order to allow the model to simulate realistic attention allocation
  patterns of human drivers. A driver model is also incorporated within QN-ACTR-SA
  architecture that can simulate human driving behavior by interacting with a driving
  simulator with the help of virtual modalities such as motor, visual and memory functions.
  A preliminary validation study is conducted to determine whether SA results of the
  model correspond to empirical data. The model is probed with SA queries similar
  to how a Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) is conducted on
  human participants. A comparative assessment demonstrates the model's ability to
  simulate drivers' SA in both easy (with fewer traffic vehicles and signboards) and
  complex (with more traffic vehicles and signboards) driving conditions.
