 abstract = {The goal of this research is to computationally model and simulate drivers' situation awareness (SA). In order to achieve this, we have developed a computational cognitive model in a cognitive architecture that can be connected to interact with a driving simulator, as means to infer quantitative predictions of drivers' SA. We demonstrate the theory of modelling and predicting SA through the lens of human cognition utilizing the QN-ACTR (Queueing Network-Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational) framework as a foundation. We integrate a dynamic visual sampling model (SEEV) to create QN-ACTR-SA in order to allow the model to simulate realistic attention allocation patterns of human drivers. A driver model is also incorporated within QN-ACTR-SA architecture that can simulate human driving behavior by interacting with a driving simulator with the help of virtual modalities such as motor, visual and memory functions. A preliminary validation study is conducted to determine whether SA results of the model correspond to empirical data. The model is probed with SA queries similar to how a Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) is conducted on human participants. A comparative assessment demonstrates the model's ability to simulate drivers' SA in both easy (with fewer traffic vehicles and signboards) and complex (with more traffic vehicles and signboards) driving conditions.},
