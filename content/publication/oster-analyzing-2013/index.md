abstract: "This paper reviews the economic literature relating to aviation safety;
  analyzes the safety record of commercial passenger aviation in the United States
  and abroad; examines aviation security as a growing dimension of aviation safety;
  and identifies emerging issues in airline safety and challenges for aviation safety
  research. Commercial airline safety has improved dramatically since the industry's
  birth over a century ago. Fatal accident rates for large scheduled jet airlines
  have fallen to the level where (along many dimensions) aviation is now the safest
  mode of commercial transportation. However, safety performance has not been evenly
  distributed across all segments of commercial aviation, nor among all countries
  and regions of the world. The finding that developing countries have much poorer
  safety records has been a persistent conclusion in aviation safety research and
  continues to be the case. Unfortunately, operations data are not available for many
  of the airlines that experience fatal accidents, so it is not possible to calculate
  reliable fatality rates for many segments of the worldwide aviation industry. Without
  more complete information, it will likely be difficult to make substantial improvements
  in the safety of these operations. Challenges to improving aviation security include:
  how much to focus on identifying the terrorists as opposed to identifying the tools
  they might use; determining how to respond to terrorist threats; and determining
  the public versus private roles in providing aviation security. The next generation
  of safety challenges now require development and understanding of new forms of data
  to improve safety in other segments of commercial aviation, and moving from a reactive,
  incident-based approach toward a more proactive, predictive and systems-based approach."
