        Rongbing Xu is a Ph.D. student in Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo, specializing in aeronautics, cognitive modeling, and human factors. Under the supervision of [Dr. Shi Cao](https://uwaterloo.ca/systems-design-engineering/profile/s34cao) and [Dr. Michael Barnett-Cowan](https://uwaterloo.ca/kinesiology-health-sciences/profiles/michael-barnett-cowan), his research focuses on enhancing pilot training and performance evaluation through computational cognitive modeling and machine learning, using real-world flight and physiological data.

        He earned his MASc in Systems Design Engineering from the University of Waterloo, where he developed a cognitive architecture-based model for simulating pilot behavior during pre-flight and take-off tasks. He also holds a B.Sc. in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics from the University of New Mexico.

        Xu has published peer-reviewed work in journals such as Journal of Aviation/Aerospace Education & Research and has presented at international conferences including the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting and the International Symposium on Aviation Psychology. His recent projects involve consumer-grade EEG and wearable technology for real-time stress detection in general aviation pilots.

        In addition to his research, Xu serves as a Teaching Assistant in systems design engineering courses and contributes actively to the professional community as the Director of Communications for the University of Waterlooâ€™s Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Student Chapter. He is a reviewer for IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems and HFES proceedings, and a member of IEEE and HFES.
