      <title>Data Platform and Information Technologies Transforming General Aviation Pilot Training</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects/wisa/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For decades, ab initio pilot training has been following flight-hour-based models and relying on instructor subjective assessment. This industry faces sustainability challenges as it needs to train pilots more efficiently and use more objective measures of competency to improve quality and reduce bias. This project will create a data platform for collecting pilot performance data. It will support multiple data sources (simulator, e-plane, traditional aircraft) and combine multiple measures (flight performance, instructor assessment, biomarkers, eye tracking). We will collect 200 hours of flight data as a start for the database, which will be essential to support the development of algorithms and technologies transforming ab initio pilot training. The platform will provide data management and data integration with other related WISA projects. The database will become an important WISA asset enabling researchers and companies to train their artificial intelligence algorithms for objective pilot assessment and build data-driven competency-based training.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Modeling Pilot Flight Performance on Pre-flight and Take-off Tasks with A Cognitive Architecture</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects/cognitive-model/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Models of cognitive architecture can be used to simulate and forecast human performance in complicated human-machine systems. The current work demonstrates a pilot model capable of performing and simulating pre-flight preparation and take-off duties. The model was developed using the Queueing Network-Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (QN-ACTR) cognitive architecture and can be connected to flight simulators like X-Plane to create various data types such as performance and mental workload. Declarative knowledge chunks, production rules, and a collection of parameters all contribute to the model’s output. A human experiment involving pre-flight and take-off tasks was conducted to acquire the data required for the model’s development. At the moment, the model can generate flight operation behaviors that are comparable to that of human pilots.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Operator Space Situation Awareness in Space Object Tracking Tasks</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects/mitacs/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A space asset such as a GPS enables navigation services for many industries and its numerous benefits have permeated the lives of people. However, due to increasing number of orbiting satellites, coupled with the threat of space debris, the need to monitor and predict trajectories of the space assets and debris became an utmost priority for space-faring nations. As more satellites are launched into low earth or geostationary orbit, the occurrence of collision with either space debris, defunct, or active satellites will increase. Space situation awareness (SSA) refers to an operator’s knowing of what is going on in the space tracking and operation tasks. The responsibility to track, monitor, and protect space assets rests on the shoulder of a SSA operator. Unfortunately, contemporary literature on SSA is scant; there are limited information on the job requirements of SSA operators and how to synthesize multi-dimensional information from space. This research helps in filling the gap of knowledge by employing cognitive engineering method to elicit knowledge from SSA operators. An interview session will be held with SSA operators to document their know-hows and procedural knowledge. The findings will provide useful insights for researchers and companies involved in research and development in this field.&lt;/p&gt;
