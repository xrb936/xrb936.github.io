This industry faces sustainability challenges as it needs to train pilots more efficiently and use more objective measures of competency to improve quality and reduce bias. This project will create a data platform for collecting pilot performance data. It will support multiple data sources (simulator, e-plane, traditional aircraft) and combine multiple measures (flight performance, instructor assessment, biomarkers, eye tracking). We will collect 200 hours of flight data as a start for the database, which will be essential to support the development of algorithms and technologies transforming ab initio pilot training. The platform will provide data management and data integration with other related WISA projects. The database will become an important WISA asset enabling researchers and companies to train their artificial intelligence algorithms for objective pilot assessment and build data-driven competency-based training.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Modeling Pilot Flight Performance on Pre-flight and Take-off Tasks with A Cognitive Architecture</title><link>https://rongbingxu.com/projects/cognitive-model/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rongbingxu.com/projects/cognitive-model/</guid><description>&lt;p>Models of cognitive architecture can be used to simulate and forecast human performance in complicated human-machine systems. The current work demonstrates a pilot model capable of performing and simulating pre-flight preparation and take-off duties. The model was developed using the Queueing Network-Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (QN-ACTR) cognitive architecture and can be connected to flight simulators like X-Plane to create various data types such as performance and mental workload. Declarative knowledge chunks, production rules, and a collection of parameters all contribute to the model’s output. A human experiment involving pre-flight and take-off tasks was conducted to acquire the data required for the model’s development. At the moment, the model can generate flight operation behaviors that are comparable to that of human pilots.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
