The results of this survey were first presented to the members of {CANSpOC} as a Scientific Letter ({DRDC}-{RDDC}-2017-L119). The current report provides an expanded version of the original Scientific Letter in terms of the detail of the findings and the inclusion of the raw data obtained in the survey. The findings revealed that there are significant {HF} issues that impact the effectiveness and efficiency with which members of the {CANSpOC} operate. These findings will contribute to the development of {HF} evaluation methodology to augment the current space common operating picture concept development and evaluation process.},

In order to achieve this, we have developed a computational cognitive model in a cognitive architecture that can be connected to interact with a driving simulator, as means to infer quantitative predictions of drivers' {SA}. We demonstrate the theory of modelling and predicting {SA} through the lens of human cognition utilizing the {QN}-{ACTR} (Queueing Network-Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational) framework as a foundation. We integrate a dynamic visual sampling model ({SEEV}) to create {QN}-{ACTR}-{SA} in order to allow the model to simulate realistic attention allocation patterns of human drivers. A driver model is also incorporated within {QN}-{ACTR}-{SA} architecture that can simulate human driving behavior by interacting with a driving simulator with the help of virtual modalities such as motor, visual and memory functions. A preliminary validation study is conducted to determine whether {SA} results of the model correspond to empirical data. The model is probed with {SA} queries similar to how a Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique ({SAGAT}) is conducted on human participants. A comparative assessment demonstrates the model's ability to simulate drivers' {SA} in both easy (with fewer traffic vehicles and signboards) and complex (with more traffic vehicles and signboards) driving conditions.},

This study built cognitive architecture models to simulate drivers' take-over reaction time in different secondary task conditions. Models were built using the queueing network-adaptive control of thought rational ({QN}-{ACTR}) cognitive architecture. Drivers' task-specific skills and knowledge were programmed as production rules. A driving simulator program was connected to the models to produce prediction of reaction time. Model results were compared with human results in both single-task and multi-task conditions. The models were built without adjusting any parameter to fit the human data. The models could produce simulation results of take-over reaction time similar to the human results in take-over conditions with visual or auditory concurrent tasks, as well as emergency response time in a manual driving condition. Overall, R square was 0.96, root mean square error ({RMSE}) was 0.5 s, and mean absolute percentage error ({MAPE}) was 9\%. The models could produce simulation results of reaction time similar to the human results from different task conditions. The production rules are plausible representations of drivers' strategies and skills. The models provide a useful tool for the evaluation of take-over alert design and the prediction of driver performance.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the economic literature relating to aviation safety; analyzes the safety record of commercial passenger aviation in the United States and abroad; examines aviation security as a growing dimension of aviation safety; and identifies emerging issues in airline safety and challenges for aviation safety research. Commercial airline safety has improved dramatically since the industry's birth over a century ago. Fatal accident rates for large scheduled jet airlines have fallen to the level where (along many dimensions) aviation is now the safest mode of commercial transportation. However, safety performance has not been evenly distributed across all segments of commercial aviation, nor among all countries and regions of the world. The finding that developing countries have much poorer safety records has been a persistent conclusion in aviation safety research and continues to be the case. Unfortunately, operations data are not available for many of the airlines that experience fatal accidents, so it is not possible to calculate reliable fatality rates for many segments of the worldwide aviation industry. Without more complete information, it will likely be difficult to make substantial improvements in the safety of these operations. Challenges to improving aviation security include: how much to focus on identifying the terrorists as opposed to identifying the tools they might use; determining how to respond to terrorist threats; and determining the public versus private roles in providing aviation security. The next generation of safety challenges now require development and understanding of new forms of data to improve safety in other segments of commercial aviation, and moving from a reactive, incident-based approach toward a more proactive, predictive and systems-based approach.},
